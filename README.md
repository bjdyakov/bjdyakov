## hi, i'm boris! ðŸ¤ 

I'm a scientist who is passionate about improving how science works. I believe that many of the problems in science emerge from a misalignment of incentives. Thinking about solutions to those problems is what has captured my attention for the last few years.

I am _**not**_ a dev, but I've written some scripts for my own data analysis in python and R. I am however excited to learn more coding (once my PhD is finished... _soon..._) and have a very simple [website](https://www.boris.zip/) that I want to build out as part of this learning process. 

Check out my website to learn more about me ðŸ˜Š
