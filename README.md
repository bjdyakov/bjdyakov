## hi, i'm boris!

I'm a scientist who is passionate about improving how science works. I believe that many of the problems in science emerge from a misalignment of incentives. Thinking about solutions to those problems is what has captured my attention for the last few years.

My exploration of approaches to fix science using blockchains and crypto (via the DeSci movement) grew my interest in blockchain infra and eventually led me to my current role with [Aligned](https://x.com/alignedlayer), a ZK proof verification layer for Ethereum.

You can mostly find me on [twitter](https://x.com/BJ_Dyakov).
